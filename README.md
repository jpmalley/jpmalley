### Hi there.

I'm a **developer** with a **design background** who can build a website from the ground up and make it look fantastic. In addition to a wealth of technical skills, I also pride myself on being a **strong communicator** who can break down complex topics without judgement or jargon. 

I spent the last 5 years as a developer, **technical project manager**, and technology department head at an ecommerce company that did $60M per year in revenue. I'm looking for my next opportunity so here are some of my best work examples:

## TeeTurtle.com Homepage & Interface 
### HTML, CSS,
