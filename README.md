### Hi there 👋

I'm a **developer** 👨‍💻 with a **design background** 👨‍🎨 who can build a website from the ground up and make it look fantastic 💅. In addition to a wealth of technical skills, I also pride myself on being a **strong communicator** who can break down complex topics without judgement or jargon. 

I spent the last 5 years as a developer, **technical project manager**, and technology department head at an ecommerce company that did $60M per year in revenue. I'm looking for my next opportunity so here are some of my best work examples:

### [TeeTurtle.com Homepage & Interface](https://www.teeturtle.com/) 
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Design, Project Management *

At the time, TeeTurtle's entire $10M ecomerce business was hosted on a bog-standard $200 per month Shopify Premium plan. With the help of a 3rd party project manager and backend developer we took the old Shopify site and duplicated all necessary functionality on our own custom PHP platform. I was responsible for spec gathering, developer write-ups, stakeholder management and, most of all, frontend design and development of the entire look and feel of the new site. 

The current TeeTurtle.com is still using the same design and interface that I created in 2019. 🔗 [Take a look here!](https://www.teeturtle.com/)
